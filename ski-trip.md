## When

## Where
Oberstdorf, Fellhorn/Kanzelwand & Ifen

## How
* Great
* Lots of fun
* Tiring

## What
We went first to Ifen. It was easy to ride there and we rode lots of blue courses. We even rode a red course. That was our first day. On the second day we went to Fellhorn. It was much harder, but we still rode lots of red courses. We rode untill Fellhorn closed. And finally, on the last day, we went again to Fellhorn, but we went all the way up to Kanzelbahn, which is the highest spot on the mountain. But it was easy. In the end we went back home.
